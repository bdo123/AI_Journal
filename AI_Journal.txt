Week 1 
This week I used to AI to condense a PDF for me so I can use it for notes for one of my classes. Additionally, I utilized it to summarize a reading for another one of my classes because I forgot to read it for the warm up that day.

Week 2 
I used AI to summarize and explain the instructions of a discussion post from INST352 to me because I was a bit confused on what I am supposed to be answering and used it to brainstorm for the topic. I once again used it to put together notes for me since I have an exam in the coming weeks. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cadff8-ce14-8009-82b1-57ec18a6db30
