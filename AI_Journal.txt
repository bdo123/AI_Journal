Week 1 
This week I used to AI to condense a PDF for me so I can use it for notes for one of my classes. Additionally, I utilized it to summarize a reading for another one of my classes because I forgot to read it for the warm up that day.

Week 2 
I used AI to summarize and explain the instructions of a discussion post from INST352 to me because I was a bit confused on what I am supposed to be answering and used it to brainstorm for the topic. I once again used it to put together notes for me since I have an exam in the coming weeks. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cadff8-ce14-8009-82b1-57ec18a6db30

Week 3 
I had a film critique assignment for my INST466 class and I was rather puzzled regarding its instructions. As a result I made use of ChatGPT to sum it up and clarify the key points of the assignment. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d42c87-c668-800f-a701-405a362a2fe6

Week 7
I did not have time to review the articles for the warm-up in one of my classes, which is becoming a trend. I used ChatGPT to summarize the readings and highlight key points so I could quickly catch up.Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/690370ad-aac4-800f-9dbc-303e5066b5c9
