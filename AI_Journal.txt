Week 1 
This week I used to AI to condense a PDF for me so I can use it for notes for one of my classes. Additionally, I utilized it to summarize a reading for another one of my classes because I forgot to read it for the warm up that day.

Week 2 
I used AI to summarize and explain the instructions of a discussion post from INST352 to me because I was a bit confused on what I am supposed to be answering and used it to brainstorm for the topic. I once again used it to put together notes for me since I have an exam in the coming weeks. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cadff8-ce14-8009-82b1-57ec18a6db30

Week 3 
I had a film critique assignment for my INST466 class and I was rather puzzled regarding its instructions. As a result I made use of ChatGPT to sum it up and clarify the key points of the assignment. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d42c87-c668-800f-a701-405a362a2fe6

Week 5
I forgot to go through the weekly assigned reading for INST466 in order to complete the warm up, so I used ChatGPT to extract key points I can use to answer the warm up prompt. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68e67f83-e0f4-800f-a49d-10d1d9b94e50

Week 6
I had to prepare for a quiz for INST352 so I used ChatGPT to analyze and provide key information that I would need to know. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68f91193-e7e8-8009-8a0b-93cdf6904b02

Week 7
I did not have time to review the articles for the warm-up in one of my classes, which is becoming a trend. I used ChatGPT to summarize the readings and highlight key points so I could quickly catch up. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/690370ad-aac4-800f-9dbc-303e5066b5c9
I also used AI to condense the instructions for a long discussion post assignment and to help me choose the prompt that would be the simplest and fastest to complete. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/69037109-5504-800f-a9a5-d6e55e2b30fd

Week 8
I had an INST314 exam this week and was allowed to bring a cheat sheet. I uploaded the practice exam questions and answer keys from the study sessions I attended to help me create the cheat sheet and review the problems I found difficult.

Week 9 
I have an INST335 exam coming up this week. It’s open-note, so I’m allowed to use lecture slides and other materials. However, I want to create a summary or cheat sheet to help me prepare, since the exam consists of multiple short essay questions. I used Google Gemini to condense the key information I might need so I can answer the questions efficiently within the 50-minute time limit. Link: https://gemini.google.com/share/385f217f7376

Week 10
I used ChatGPT to summarize this week’s INST335 lecture slides and extract key information in order to complete the weekly quizzes. Link: https://chatgpt.com/share/691b4c43-6634-800f-b43b-d51f674a7e5d
